# arduino-gps-tracker
## Synopsis
An Arduino-based GPS tracking solution. One Arduino and Ublox Neo-6m (GY-NEO6MV2) GPS module is used as the GPS tracking device. The other is an Arduino handheld controller which requests information from the tracking device and displays the coordinates, GPS location and location on a map. By default, the display is a 128x160 1.8" TFT LCD but the code can be adapted for other displays. Communication occurs between the two devices with the HC-12 wireless serial communication module. This project can be adapted to use other methods of wireless communication such as the XBee or GSM mobile network. Please make sure the frequency used and transmitting power is legal in your country.
